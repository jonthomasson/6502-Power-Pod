This is a very simple power supply I built using linear regulators for a few projects a year or two ago. I've used it a number of times since, and it's proved to be very stable and reliable at delivering 5v and 3.3v. The supply provides an on/off switch and has a barrel jack that accepts between 7-12v dc.
